							<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Cryptocurrencies</h1>
							<p class="w3-large">
								A cryptocurrency at its core, is a set of codes, which follows a single protocol. This protocol allows people to exchange virtual currency, by adding to a virtual ledger. These transactions are secured using cryptographic encryptions, and verified by third party miners by completing proof of works of block chains. This virtual currency can then be exchanged into real money at any time using an exchange rate.

							<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Cryptography and Security</h1>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Cryptography is the act of solving and creating codes. In cryptocurrencies, cryptographic encryption is used to secure transfers between users, and keep user transactions almost one hundred percent anonymous by creating unique digital signatures on every transaction. These digital signatures are extremely hard to recreate with a one in 2<sup>256</sup> chance to recreate. By comparison an average online banking information is held to a 128 bit security or a one in 2<sup>128</sup> chance to recreate your personal information.

							<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Virtual Ledgers and Block Chains</h1>
							<p class="w3-large">
								A virtual ledger is a virtual list of all transactions made with the cryptocurrency. This ledger is public to all users, but individual transaction are cryptographically encrypted meaning they are all practicably anonymous. Unlike regular currencies, all users of the cryptocurrency hold this ledger, while regular currencies have a singular ledger typically kept within a bank. Every time a transaction has occurred, all other ledgers receive this message and add it to their list. Every transaction is sometimes referred to as blocks and when blocks are added to existing ledgers, this is referred to as block chains. To ensure all blockchains and ledgers are the same, users “listen” for the longest chain with the most “work” put into them.

							<p class="w3-large">
								Users listen for the block chain with the most amount of “work” put into it. This work is in the form of third party “miners” who, to put simply, solve specific cryptographical problems, and when find an answer, publish their work to the blockchain. When they do this, the chain becomes verified. Aswell, these third parties receive a reward for doing this work, hence, “mining” for this currency.

							<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Decentralization</h1>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Cryptocurrencies are decentralized because they are not owned by a single entity and instead owned by every user on the system. Due to this decentralization, governments cannot directly control or regulate this currency. They act completely separate of other economies and do not need a governemt to issue more units. The only interaction that occurs between cryptocurrency and regular currencies are when users want to exchange between the two, but even still they are only worth what people are willing to pay for them. This lack of regulation leads to huge fluctuations in price and worth.

							<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Black Market Exchanges</h1>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Cryptocurrencies allow for easy, secure transactions, which are untraceable and anonymous. These are traits that people who are transferring illegal funds, find very appealing. With no government regulations centering on the transaction made through cryptocurrencies, any party is able to transfer sums to buy products, even if they fall into the black market or illegitimate items.

							<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Money Laundering</h1>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Virtual anonymity is also a perfect trait that is very appealing to money laundering parties. Cryptocurrencies unintentionally allow for an easy way to launder illegal funds, do to the untraceability of virtual crypto funds. However, their are international organizations who specialize in the reduction of crypto laundering such as the Financial Action Task Force.

							<h1 class="w3-text-teal">Man Made Fluctuations</h1>
							<p class="w3-large">
								Another critical issue with cryptocurrencies are their extreme volatility. Prices of virtual currencies can change dramatically within short periods of time and can be intentionally altered by individuals or parties with large virtual holdings. By periodically withdrawing and depositing large sums (possibly into the millions) into the currency, these parties can create artificial fluctuations in the stock. When this swing in price occurs, these parties can invest when the stock is low, then watch as their money increases with the stock. A big reason this is able to happen is because there is little to no regulation on limits or fees on transactions.

							<p class="w3-large">
								Cryptocurrencies are by design, an international currency and are not directly affected by which nation they are used within. Currently, most countries and nation states have set out a general policy on cryptocurrencies, either allowing them completely, partially or banning the use of them all together. These decisions are made by-nationally, and there is no current direct international policy which is followed by all nations. Currently, Canada allows the use of cryptocurrencies and are subject to tax laws. Aswell, cryptocurrencies are legal in the United States, but are not seen as legal tender.

							<p>
								Although there are many lucrative uses for cryptocurrencies, nations are dealing with them on their own. Such as in the United States of America. FinCEN, is a bureau of the US department of Treasury. Its mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit use and combat money laundering schemes. It carries out these missions by receiving and maintaining financial transaction data, analyzing that data for law enforcement needs, and building cooperations with counterpart organizations in other countries and with international bodies. FinCen is just one of the many organizations and policies nations have to stop illicit crypto activity, while internationally organizations are looking for more options.

								Cryptocurrencies are run off a decentralized basis. This means that these currencies are out of national control, which could possibly decline national power, if the country's wealth is being stored elsewhere. This can be looked at as a positive or negative. Negative, national power declines, but positive, there could be a decentralized form of finance on a global scale, a form of universal currency if circumstances were just right. Imagine living in a world where there was a globally accepted means of payment.

Properly regulate current currencies with a self regulatory body. Develop proper assurance systems along with instituting quality custody solutions to safeguard assets. In order to do this, nations and international organizations must ask the question: Do they adapt current regulations or do they create new regulations on top of the old ones?
